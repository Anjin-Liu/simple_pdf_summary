## Financial Summary Report

This report analyzes the financial health of the company based on its Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended June 30th.

**Key Highlights:**

* **Significant Asset Growth:** Total assets have more than doubled, increasing from $7.843 million to $16.444 million. This is primarily driven by the acquisition of land and buildings ($10 million) and an increase in investment property ($170,000).
* **Increased Debt Financing:**  Borrowings have significantly increased to $8 million in the current year, compared to none in the previous year. This likely financed the acquisition of land and buildings.
* **Decreased Liquidity:** Cash and cash equivalents have decreased substantially from $4.955 million to $3.093 million. This decrease is despite the influx of cash from borrowings, indicating significant cash outflows related to investments.
* **Lower Operating Cash Flow:** Net cash from operating activities has decreased from $902,000 to $536,000. While total cash received from operations increased slightly, cash used in operations also increased, leading to a lower net cash flow.
* **Heavy Investment Activity:** The company has made substantial investments in non-current assets, primarily land and buildings. This is reflected in the large negative net cash flow from investing activities of $(10.398) million.
* **Stable Equity:** While net assets and total equity have seen a modest increase from $6.918 million to $7.447 million, this growth is overshadowed by the significant increase in liabilities.

**Statement of Financial Position Analysis:**

* **Current Ratio:** The current ratio has decreased from 6.95 in the previous year to 4.71 in the current year. This indicates a reduced ability to meet short-term obligations with current assets, although the ratio remains above the generally accepted healthy level of 1.5.  The decrease is primarily due to the significant drop in cash and cash equivalents.
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** The debt-to-equity ratio has increased dramatically from 0.02 in the previous year to 1.09 in the current year. This signifies a much higher reliance on debt financing and increased financial risk.
* **Asset Composition Shift:** The acquisition of land and buildings has significantly shifted the company's asset composition towards non-current assets.

**Statement of Cash Flows Analysis:**

* **Operating Cash Flow:** While positive, the decrease in operating cash flow raises concerns about the company's ability to generate cash from its core business operations. Further investigation into the increased operating expenses (employees and suppliers) is warranted.
* **Investing Cash Flow:** The large negative investing cash flow is expected given the significant investments in land and buildings.  This is a one-time event, but its long-term impact on profitability and cash flow needs to be assessed.
* **Financing Cash Flow:** The large inflow from borrowings has financed the company's investment activities.  However, the increased debt burden will require careful management of future cash flows to meet debt servicing obligations.

**Overall Financial Health:**

The company has experienced significant growth in assets, but this growth has been fueled by a substantial increase in debt. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow raises concerns about the company's short-term liquidity and ability to generate cash from operations.  While the investments in non-current assets may contribute to future profitability, the company needs to carefully manage its debt levels and improve its operating cash flow to maintain a healthy financial position.  Further analysis is required to understand the drivers behind the increased operating expenses and the potential returns from the investments made.  Reviewing the notes accompanying these statements is crucial for a complete understanding of the company's financial position.
